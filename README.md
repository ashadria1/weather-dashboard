# Weather Dashboard

I built a weather dashboard with form inputs that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS, using the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) to retrieve weather data for cities, and `localStorage` to store any persistent data.  When a user searches for a city, they are presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history in local storage.  When a user views current weather conditions for that city, they are presented with the city name, the date, the temperature, the "feels like" temperature, the humidity, the wind speed, and an icon representation of weather conditions.  When a user views future weather conditions for that city, they are presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, the temperature, the humidity, and an icon representation of weather conditions.  When a user clicks on a city in the search history, they are again presented with current and future conditions for that city.  When the user re-opens the weather dashboard, they are presented with their previously searched city forecasts.
